## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "camo"
```

## Getting Started

Add your Camo host and key to your environment or create an initializer `config/initializers/camo.rb`.

```ruby
ENV["CAMO_HOST"] = "https://camo.herokuapp.com"
ENV["CAMO_KEY"] = "rzsJbU5YxDfdP3FXHjshtgEN"
